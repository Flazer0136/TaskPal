## ðŸ§­ Introduction

**TaskPal** is a socially impactful platform built to support **independent living** for **senior citizens** and **persons with disabilities (PWDs)**.  
It bridges the gap between individuals needing assistance with everyday tasks (such as **cleaning**, **moving**, and **gardening**) and trusted, local providers willing to assistâ€”all within a secure, user-friendly environment.

This application was developed as the Capstone project for **CPRO-290X (Computer Programming Capstone)**.
